# Project 0 - Search

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For this project, I built a replica of Google. The project contains 3 pages, one for Google Search, one for Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search. On the Google Search page, there are links in the upper-right of the page which will take the user to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there is a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search. On the Google Search page, the user is able to type in a query and click "Google Search" to be taken to the Google Search results page. The search bar is centered with rounded corners and the search button is also centered and below the search bar. On the Google Image Search page, the user is able to type in a query and be taken to the Google Image search results. On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the four fields on the page and be taken to the results for the Google Advanced Search. Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options are stacked vertically, and all of the text fields are left aligned. Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button is blue with white text. The Google Search page contains an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page. The CSS throughout the project matches Google’s own CSS as best as possible.
